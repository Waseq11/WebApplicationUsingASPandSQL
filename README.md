Hello,
This is a Web Application that I developed using ASP.Net MVC/ASP.Net Core MVC and MySQL on Visual Studio Code
It has a Database design and implementation using MySQL. I created Client and created projects and assigned to clients.
In the database, all the projects and information related to that client is shown.
I used the ASP.Net C# framework for this work.
